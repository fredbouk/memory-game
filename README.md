# Memory Game Project

## Project Description

This is a version of the classic memory game 'Concentration'. 

Based on some static HTML and CSS [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) I converted it into an interactive game using JavaScript, DOM selectors and Event Listeners.

### How the Game Works

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!



The game keeps track of the time and the number of moves you've made.

You begin with 3 stars displayed on the score panel area. The number of moves you make during the game will decrease this star rating.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
